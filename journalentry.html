    Today started our personal project. I am making the project for Ellie. A question about either me or her will appear and there will be an input box to type an answer. If the answer is correct then a funny photo that bounces up and down of me, her or both of us together. This is a way for the gift to be personal to us.

            We had our second class since being back from break. I created a html file that is a function that makes one hundred flies change position every 100miliseconds. I also feel confident in css and html. I am beginning to become more confident in writing javascript.

            <div class="label">Week 20: Monday April 13th:</div>
            I have not updated my progress journal in a while. This week I started a new coding project to create a photography porfolio in Javascript. First I created a div with the ID of slideshow, then in the style section I created characteristics to the style section. After, in the script section I created strings in an array to with a variable. Lastly, I created a function changenumber so that the slideshow/strings appear randomly.

            <div class="label">Week 21: Monday April 20th:</div>
           I continued to work on my photography portfolio slideshow. I put the photo urls in each of the differnet strings in the array so that the function can refer to the photos, so they can appear in a slideshow.

           I continued to work on my photography portfolio slideshow  and menu bar for the website. Also for homework we read to two articles. The part I found most interesting about the first article is that people have to train the AI to recognize the differnt subjects. In the article, a woman who was not a scientist was looking for Polyps and marking them on the computer for the Computer to learn how to recognize the certain Polyps. I thought it was intersting that 1000s of average people were part-take in this is job. The other article was about how AI technology is helping scientist collect and organize data about the ocean. I thought it was interesting that scientist are using AI technology to help and study whales.
